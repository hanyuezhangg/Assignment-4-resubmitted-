Song Title: A&W Lyrics

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nineI haven't seen my mother in a long, long timeI mean, look at meLook at the length of my hair, and my face, the shape of my bodyDo you really think I give a damnWhat I do after years of just hearing them talking?I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the RamadaIt doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matterCall him up, "Come into my bedroom"Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floorIt's not about havin' someone to love me anymorеThis is the experiеnce of bein' an American whoreCalled up one drunk, called up anotherForensic Files wasn't onWatching Teenage Diary of a GirlWondering what went wrongI'm a princess, I'm divisiveAsk me why, why, why I'm like thisMaybe I'm just kinda like thisI don't know, maybe I'm just like this
