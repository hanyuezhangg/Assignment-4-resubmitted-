Song Title: Mariners Apartment Complex Lyrics

You took my sadness out of contextAt the Mariners Apartment ComplexI ain't no candle in the windI'm the board, the lightning, the thunderKind of girl who's gonna make you wonderWho you are and who you've beenAnd who I've been is with you on these beachesYour Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weaknessMaybe I could save you from your sinsSo kiss the sky and whisper to JesusMy, my, my, you found this, you need thisTake a deep breath, baby, let me inYou lose your way, just take my handYou're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me againDon't look too far, right where you are, that's where I amI'm your manI'm your manThey mistook my kindness for weaknessI fucked up, I know that, but JesusCan't a girl just do the best she can?Catch a wave and take in the sweetnessThink about it, the darkness, the deepnessAll the things that make me who I am
