Song Title: Doin' Time Lyrics

Summertime, and the livin's easyBradley's on the microphone with Ras MGAll the people in the dance will agreeThat we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the partyAnd dance to the rhythm, it gets harderMe and my girl, we got this relationshipI love her so bad, but she treats me like shitOn lockdown, like a penitentiaryShe spreads her lovin' all overAnd when she gets home, there's none left for meSummertime, and the livin's easyBradley's on the microphone with Ras MGAll the people in the dance will agreeThat we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the partyAnd dance to the rhythm, it gets harderOh, take this veil from off my eyesMy burning sun will, some day, riseSo, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?Said, I'm gonna play with myselfShow them how we come off the shelf
