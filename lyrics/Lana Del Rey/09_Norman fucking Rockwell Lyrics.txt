Song Title: Norman fucking Rockwell Lyrics

Goddamn, man-childYou fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"You're fun and you’re wildBut you don't know the half of the shit that you put me throughYour poetry's bad and you blame the newsBut I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah'Cause you're just a manIt's just what you doYour head in your handsAs you color me blueYeah, you're just a manAll through and throughYour head in your handsAs you color me blueBlue, blue, blueGoddamn, man-childYou act like a kid even though you stand six foot twoSelf-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-allYou talk to the walls when the party gets bored of youBut I don't get bored, I just see it throughWhy wait for the best when I could have you? You?
