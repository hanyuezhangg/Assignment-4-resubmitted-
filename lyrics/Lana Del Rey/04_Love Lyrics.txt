Song Title: Love Lyrics

Look at you, kids, with your vintage musicComin' through satellites while cruisin'You're part of the past, but now you're the futureSignals crossing can get confusin'It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazySometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazyYou get ready, you get all dressed upTo go nowhere in particularBack to work or the coffee shopDoesn't matter 'cause it's enoughTo be young and in lo-oveTo be young and in lo-oveLook at you, kids, you know you're the coolestThe world is yours and you can't refuse itSeen so much, you could get the bluesBut that don't mean that you should abuse itThough it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazyI know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
