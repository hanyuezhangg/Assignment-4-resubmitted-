Song Title: Off to the Races Lyrics

My old man is a bad manBut I can't deny, the way he holds my handAnd he grabs me, he has me by my heartHe doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas pastHe doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about meHe loves me with every beat of his cocaine heartSwimmin' pool, glimmering darlin'White bikini off with my red nail polishWatch me in the swimming pool, bright blue ripplesYou sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal, yeahLight of my life, fire of my loinsBe a good baby, do what I wantLight of my life, fire of my loinsGimme them gold coins, gimme them coinsAnd I'm off to the racesCases of Bacardi chasersChasin' me all over town'Cause he knows I'm wastedFacin' time again at Rikers IslandAnd I won't get outBecause I'm crazy, babyI need you to come here and save meI'm your little scarlet, starletSingin' in the gardenKiss me on my open mouthReady for you
