Song Title: Young and Beautiful Lyrics

I've seen the world, done it allHad my cake nowDiamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air nowHot summer nights, mid-JulyWhen you and I were forever wildThe crazy days, city lightsThe way you'd play with me like a childWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?I know you will, I know you will, I know that you willWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage nowChanneling angels in the new age nowHot summer days, rock and rollThe way you'd play for me at your showAnd all the ways I got to knowYour pretty face and electric soulWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?I know you will, I know you will, I know that you willWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
