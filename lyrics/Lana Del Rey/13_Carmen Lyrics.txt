Song Title: Carmen Lyrics

Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problemLyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelfIt's alarming, honestly, how charming she can beFooling everyone, telling 'em she's having funShe says, "You don't wanna be like meDon't wanna see all the things I've seenI'm dyin', I'm dyin'"She says, "You don't wanna get this wayFamous and dumb at an early ageLyin', I'm lyin"The boys, the girls, they all like CarmenShe gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyesShe laughs like God, her mind's like a diamondAudiotune lies, she's still shinin'Like lightning, oh-ohLike lightningCarmen, Carmen, stayin' up 'til morningOnly seventeen, but she walks the streets so meanIt's alarming, truly, how disarmin' you can beEatin' soft ice cream, Coney Island queen
