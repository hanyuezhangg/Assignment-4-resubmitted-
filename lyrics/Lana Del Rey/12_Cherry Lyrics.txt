Song Title: Cherry Lyrics

Love , I said real love is like feelin' no fearWhen you're standin' in the face of danger 'Cause you just want it so muchA touch , from your real loveIs like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah Darlin', darlin', darlin'I fall to pieces when I'm with youI fall to piecesMy cherries  and wine, rosemary and thymeAnd all of my peaches are ruinedLove , is it real love?It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against ya And you just stay lined up, yeah Darlin', darlin', darlin'I fall to pieces when I'm with youI fall to pieces My cherries and wine, rosemary and thymeAnd all of my peaches Are ruined
