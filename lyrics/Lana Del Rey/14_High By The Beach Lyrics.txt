Song Title: High By The Beach Lyrics

High, highHigh, highBoy, look at you lookin' at meI know you know how I feelLovin' you is hard, bein' here's harderYou take the wheelI don't wanna do this anymoreIt's so surrealI can't surviveIf this is all that's realAll I wanna do is get high by the beachGet high by the beach, get highAll I wanna do is get by by the beachGet by, baby, baby, bye-byeThe truth is I never bought into your bullshitWhen you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know thatAll I wanted to do was get high by the beachGet high, baby, baby, bye-byeBoy, look at you lookin' at meI know you don't understandYou could be a bad motherfuckerBut that don't make you a manNow you're just another one of my problemsBecause you got out of handWe won't surviveWe're sinkin' into the sand
