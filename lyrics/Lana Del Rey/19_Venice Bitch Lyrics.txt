Song Title: Venice Bitch Lyrics

Fear fun, fear loveFresh out of fucks foreverTryin' to be stronger for youIce cream, ice queenI dream in jeans and leatherLive stream, I'm sweet for youOh God, miss you on my lipsIt's me, your little Venice bitchOn the stoop with the neighborhood kidsCallin' out, bang bang, kiss kissYou're in the yard, I light the fireAnd as the summer fades awayNothing gold can stayYou write, I tour, we make it workYou're beautiful and I'm insaneWe're American-madeGive me HallmarkOne dream, one life, one loverPaint me happy in blueNorman RockwellNo hype under our coversIt's just me and you
