Song Title: Lust for Life Lyrics

OhClimb up the H of the Hollywood sign In these stolen moments, the world is mineThere's nobody here, just us togetherKeepin' me hot like July forever'Cause we're the masters of our own fateWe're the captains of our own soulsThere's no way for us to come late'Cause, boy, we're gold, boy, we're goldAnd I was likeTake off, take off, take off all your clothesTake off, take off, take off all your clothesTake off, take off, take off all of your clothesThey say only the good die youngThat just ain't right'Cause we're having too much funToo much fun tonight, yeahAnd a lust for life And a lust for life Keeps us alive Keeps us alive And a lust for life And a lust for life Keeps us alive Keeps us alive
