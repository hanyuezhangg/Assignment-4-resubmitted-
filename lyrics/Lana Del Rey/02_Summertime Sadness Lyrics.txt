Song Title: Summertime Sadness Lyrics

Kiss me hard before you goSummertime sadnessI just wanted you to knowThat, baby, you the bestI got my red dress on tonightDancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlightDone my hair up real big, beauty queen styleHigh heels off, I'm feelin' aliveOh my God, I feel it in the airTelephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snareHoney, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhereNothin' scares me anymore Kiss me hard before you goSummertime sadnessI just wanted you to knowThat, baby, you the bestI got that summertime, summertime sadnessSu-su-summertime, summertime sadnessGot that summertime, summertime sadnessOh, oh, oh
