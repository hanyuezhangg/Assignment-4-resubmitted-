Song Title: Ultraviolence Lyrics

He used to call me DNThat stood for Deadly Nightshade'Cause I was filled with poisonBut blessed with beauty and rageJim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kissJim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kidsWith his ultraviolenceUltraviolenceUltraviolenceUltraviolenceI can hear sirens, sirensHe hit me and it felt like a kissI can hear violins, violinsGive me all of that ultraviolenceHe used to call me poisonLike I was poison ivyI could have died right there'Cause he was right beside meJim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true loveJim taught me that, loving him was never enough
