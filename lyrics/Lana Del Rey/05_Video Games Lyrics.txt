Song Title: Video Games Lyrics

Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast carWhistlin' my nameOpen up a beer and you say, "Get over hereAnd play a video game"I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressedTake that body downtownI say, "You the bestest," lean in for a big kiss, put his favorite perfume on"Go play your video game"It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I doI tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with youTell me all the things you wanna doI heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?It's better than I ever even knewThey say that the world was built for twoOnly worth living if somebody is loving youAnd baby, now you doMmmSingin' in the old bars, swinging with the old starsLivin' for the fameKissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild dartsVideo gamesHe holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing starsThis is all I think ofWatchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's, this is my idea of funPlayin' video games
