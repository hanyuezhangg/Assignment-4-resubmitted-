Song Title: Born to Die Lyrics

Why? Who? Me? Why? Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish lineOh, my heart, it breaks every step that I takeBut I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mineWalking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?I feel so alone on a Friday nightCan you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?It's like I told you, honey Don't make me sad, don't make me crySometimes, love is not enoughAnd the road gets tough, I don't know whyKeep makin' me laugh, let's go get highThe road is long, we carry onTry to have fun in the meantimeCome and take a walk on the wild sideLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rainYou like your girls insane Choose your last words, this is the last time'Cause you and I, we were born to die
