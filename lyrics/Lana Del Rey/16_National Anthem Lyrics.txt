Song Title: National Anthem Lyrics

Money is the anthem of successSo before we go out, what's your address?I'm your national anthemGod, you're so handsomeTake me to the Hamptons, Bugatti VeyronHe loves to romance 'emReckless abandonHoldin' me for ransom, upper echelonHe says to be cool, but I don't know how yetWind in my hair, hand on the back of my neckI said, "Can we party later on?" He said, "Yes" Tell me I'm your national anthemTell me I'm your national anthemRed, white, blue is in the skySummer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyesI'm your national anthem
