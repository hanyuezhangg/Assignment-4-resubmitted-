Song Title: West Coast Lyrics

Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"But you've got the musicYou've got the music in you, don't you?Down on the West coast, I get this feeling likeIt all could happen, that's why I'm leavingYou for the moment, you for the momentBoy Blue, yeah, youYou're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touchYou say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so muchBut something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lushYour love, your love, my loveI can see my baby swingingHis Parliament's on fire and his hands are upOn the balcony and I'm singingOoh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in loveI can see my sweet boy swayingHe's crazy y cubano como yo, la-laOn the balcony and I'm sayingMove, baby, move, baby, I'm in loveI'm in love I'm in love
