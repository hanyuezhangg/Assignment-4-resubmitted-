Song Title: Cinnamon Girl Lyrics

Cinnamon in my teethFrom your kiss, you're touching meAll the pills that you takeViolet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't workYou try to push me out, but I just find my way back inViolet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I winThere's things I wanna say to youBut I'll just let you liveLike if you hold me without hurting meYou'll be the first who ever didThere's things I wanna talk aboutBut better not to giveBut if you hold me without hurting meYou'll be the first who ever didAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ahHold me, love me, touch me, honeyBe the first who ever didAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ahHold me, love me, touch me, honeyBe the first who ever did
